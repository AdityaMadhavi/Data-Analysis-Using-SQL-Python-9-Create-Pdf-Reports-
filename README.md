I have demonstrated how to use SQL queries to extract the data you need from the database. Then, I'll use Pandas to manipulate and transform the data, and show you how to create interactive charts with Plotly Express.

Once we have our data prepped and ready, I'll use the FPDF library to generate a beautiful PDF report.
